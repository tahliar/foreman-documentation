= Installing {ProjectServer}

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
When you install {ProjectServer} from a connected network, you can obtain packages and receive updates directly from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network.

Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer}, perform the initial configuration, and import subscription manifests.

ifeval::["{build}" != "foreman-deb"]
Before you continue, consider which manifests are relevant for your environment. For more information on manifests, see link:{BaseURL}content_management_guide/managing_subscriptions/[Managing Subscriptions] in the _Content Management Guide_.
endif::[]


NOTE: You cannot register {ProjectServer} to itself.

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
Use the following procedures to install {ProjectServer} and perform the initial configuration.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
On CentOS, you can install {Project} with or without the Katello plug-in. If you are a new user, consider installing {Project} with the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman-deb"]
On Debian or Ubuntu operating systems, installations with the Katello plug-in are not supported. Ignore any references to the Katello plug-in.
endif::[]

Note that the {ProjectX} installation script is based on Puppet, which means that if you run the installation script more than once, it might overwrite any manual configuration changes.
‚Å†
To avoid this and determine which future changes apply, use the `--noop` argument when you run the installation script. This argument ensures that no actual changes are made. Potential changes are written to `/var/log/foreman-installer.log`.

Files are always backed up and so you can revert any unwanted changes. For example, in the foreman-installer logs, you can see an entry similar to the following about Filebucket:

[options="wrap"]
----
/Stage[main]/Dhcp/File[/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf]: Filebucketed /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf to puppet with sum 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1
----

You can restore the previous file as follows:

[options="wrap"]
----
# puppet filebucket -l \
restore /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 622d9820b8e764ab124367c68f5fa3a1

== Specifying Installation Options

Install {ProjectServer} using the `{foreman-installer}` installation script. Choose from one of the following methods:

* xref:performing_initial_configuration_sat_server_manual[]. This method is performed by running the installation script with one or more command options. The command options override the corresponding default initial configuration options and are recorded in the {Project} answer file. You can run the script as often as needed to configure any necessary options.

* xref:performing_initial_configuration_sat_server_answerfile[]. This method is performed by using an answer file to automate the configuration process when running the installation script. The default {Project} answer file is `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/{project-context}-answers.yaml`. The answer file in use is set by the `answer_file` directive in the `/etc/foreman-installer/scenarios.d/{project-context}.yaml` configuration file.

NOTE: Depending on the options that you use when running the {Project} installer, the configuration can take several minutes to complete. An administrator can view the answer file to see previously used options for both methods.
