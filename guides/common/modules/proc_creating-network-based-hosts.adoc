= Creating Network-based Hosts on {CRname}

Use this procedure to create a new host on {CRname} using network-based provisioning.

The new host must have access either to {ProjectServer}'s integrated {SmartProxy} or an external {SmartProxyServer} on a {CRname} virtual network, so that the host has access to PXE provisioning services. This new host entry triggers the {CRname} server to create and start a virtual machine. If the virtual machine detects the defined {SmartProxyServer} through the virtual network, the virtual machine boots to PXE and begins to install the chosen operating system.

.DHCP Conflicts
If you use a virtual network on the {CRname} server for provisioning, select a network that does not provide DHCP assignments. This causes DHCP conflicts with {ProjectServer} when booting new hosts.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Create Host*.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name that you want to become the provisioned system's host name.
. Click the *Organization* and *Location* tabs to ensure that the provisioning context is automatically set to the current context.
. From the *Host Group* list, select the host group that you want to use to populate the form.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the {CRname} connection.
. From the *Compute Profile* list, select a profile to use to automatically populate virtual machine-based settings.
. Click the *Interfaces* tab and click *Edit* on the host's interface.
. Verify that the fields are automatically populated, particularly the following items:
* The *Name* from the *Host* tab becomes the *DNS name*.
* {ProjectServer} automatically assigns an IP address for the new host.
* The *MAC address* field is blank. The {CRname} server assigns a MAC address to the host.
* The *Managed*, *Primary*, and *Provision* options are automatically selected for the first interface on the host. If not, select them.
* The {CRname}-specific fields are populated with settings from your compute profile. Modify these settings if required.

. Click the *Operating System* tab and confirm that the fields are automatically populated.
. Set the *Provisioning Method* to *Network Based*.
. Click *Resolve* in *Provisioning Templates* to check the new host can identify the right provisioning templates to use.
. Click the *Virtual Machine* tab and confirm that the fields are automatically populated with details from the host group and compute profile. Modify these settings to suit your needs.
ifeval::["{build}" == "foreman"]
. If you use the Katello plugin: Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Click the *Parameters* tab, and ensure that a parameter exists that provides an activation key. If not, add an activation key.
endif::[]
. Click *Submit*.

.For CLI Users

* Create the host with the `hammer host create` command and include `--provision-method build`. Replace the values in the following example with the appropriate values for your environment.
