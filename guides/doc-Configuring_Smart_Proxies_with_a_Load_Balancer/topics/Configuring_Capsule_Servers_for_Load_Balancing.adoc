. xref:configuring-capsule-server-with-default-ssl-certificates-for-load-balancing-without-puppet[]
. xref:configuring-capsule-server-with-default-ssl-certificates-for-load-balancing-with-puppet[]
. xref:configuring-capsule-server-with-custom-ssl-certificates-for-load-balancing-without-puppet[]
. xref:configuring-capsule-server-with-custom-ssl-certificates-for-load-balancing-with-puppet[]

Use different file names for the Katello certificates you create for each Capsule Server. For example, name the certificate archive file with the Capsule Server FQDN.
