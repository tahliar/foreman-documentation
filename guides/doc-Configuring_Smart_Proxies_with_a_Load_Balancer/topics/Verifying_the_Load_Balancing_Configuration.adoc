= Verifying the Load Balancing Configuration

You can verify the load balancing configuration by completing the following steps for each Capsule Server that you configure:

. Shut down the base operating system for your Capsule Server.
. Verify that content or subscription management features are available on the client registered to this Capsule. For example, enter the `subscription-manager refresh` command on the client.
. Restart the base operating system for your Capsule Server.
